// For syncing events we have two separate job queues. One is for

// realtime syncing of events. The reason for having these two be
// separated is that we don't want any ongoing backfilling action
// to delay realtime syncing (which tries to catch up to the head
// of the blockchain). Apart from these, we also have several job
// queues (that are single-threaded) which act as writing buffers
// for queries that are prone to database deadlocks (these are ft
// and nft transfer events writes which can run into deadlocks on
// concurrent upserts of the balances):
